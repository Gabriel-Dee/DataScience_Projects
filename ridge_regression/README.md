# Project Overview

In this project, we'll build a ridge regression algorithm from scratch.  We'll cover what ridge regression is, how it works, and how to implement it in Python.  Ridge regression is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms, and learning how it works can help you use it more effectively.

We'll create our algorithm using python and pandas.  We'll then compare it to the reference implementation from scikit-learn.

It's recommended to watch the video on [linear regression](https://youtu.be/z2hpinQggNM) before this one.
